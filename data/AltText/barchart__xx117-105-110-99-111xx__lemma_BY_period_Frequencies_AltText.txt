This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 11.32 and an absolute frequency of 74. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 4.61 and an absolute frequency of 99. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 99 ; absolute frequency: 4.60786595299046. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 74 ; absolute frequency: 11.3201774514303. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
