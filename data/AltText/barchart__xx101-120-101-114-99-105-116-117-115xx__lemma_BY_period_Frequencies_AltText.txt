This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The II.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 26.18 and an absolute frequency of 10. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 12.61 and an absolute frequency of 271. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 271 ; absolute frequency: 12.6134512450547. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 0.305950741930549. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 10 ; absolute frequency: 26.1780104712042. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
