This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The IV.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 31.45 and an absolute frequency of 14. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 2.51 and an absolute frequency of 54. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 54 ; absolute frequency: 2.51338142890389. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 13 ; absolute frequency: 1.98867982254857. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 14 ; absolute frequency: 31.4536059312514
