This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 34.3 and an absolute frequency of 737. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 8.41 and an absolute frequency of 55. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 737 ; absolute frequency: 34.3030020944845. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 55 ; absolute frequency: 8.4136454030901. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 11 ; absolute frequency: 28.7958115183246. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
