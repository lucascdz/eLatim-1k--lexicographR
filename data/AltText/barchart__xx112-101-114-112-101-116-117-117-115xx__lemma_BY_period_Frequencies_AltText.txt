This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 2.75 and an absolute frequency of 18. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 1.82 and an absolute frequency of 39. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 39 ; absolute frequency: 1.81521992087503. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 18 ; absolute frequency: 2.75355667737494. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
