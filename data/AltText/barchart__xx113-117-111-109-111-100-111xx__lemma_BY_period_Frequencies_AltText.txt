This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The IV.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 8.99 and an absolute frequency of 4. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 7.34 and an absolute frequency of 48. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 35 ; absolute frequency: 1.629043518734. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 48 ; absolute frequency: 7.34281780633318. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 4 ; absolute frequency: 8.98674455178612
