This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 24.02 and an absolute frequency of 157. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 12.01 and an absolute frequency of 258. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 258 ; absolute frequency: 12.0083779380963. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 157 ; absolute frequency: 24.0171332415481. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 5.23560209424084. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
