This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The II.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 13.09 and an absolute frequency of 5. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 5.2 and an absolute frequency of 34. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 80 ; absolute frequency: 3.72352804282057. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 34 ; absolute frequency: 5.20116261281934. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 5 ; absolute frequency: 13.0890052356021. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
