This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 29.46 and an absolute frequency of 633. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 5.2 and an absolute frequency of 34. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 633 ; absolute frequency: 29.4624156388178. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 34 ; absolute frequency: 5.20116261281934. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 9 ; absolute frequency: 23.5602094240838. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
