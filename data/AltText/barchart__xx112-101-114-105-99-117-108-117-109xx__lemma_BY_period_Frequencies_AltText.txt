This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 10.61 and an absolute frequency of 228. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 10.61 and an absolute frequency of 228. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 228 ; absolute frequency: 10.6120549220386. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 33 ; absolute frequency: 5.04818724185406. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
