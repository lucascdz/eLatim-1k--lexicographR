This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 8.38 and an absolute frequency of 180. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 8.38 and an absolute frequency of 180. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 180 ; absolute frequency: 8.37793809634629. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 45 ; absolute frequency: 6.88389169343736. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 3 ; absolute frequency: 6.74005841383959
