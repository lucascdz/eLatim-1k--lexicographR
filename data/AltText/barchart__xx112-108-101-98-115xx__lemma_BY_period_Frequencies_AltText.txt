This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The II.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 7.85 and an absolute frequency of 3. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 4.51 and an absolute frequency of 97. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 97 ; absolute frequency: 4.51477775191994. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 4 ; absolute frequency: 0.611901483861098. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 3 ; absolute frequency: 7.85340314136126. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
