This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 30.75 and an absolute frequency of 201. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 24.58 and an absolute frequency of 528. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 528 ; absolute frequency: 24.5752850826158. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 201 ; absolute frequency: 30.7480495640202. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 6 ; absolute frequency: 13.4801168276792
