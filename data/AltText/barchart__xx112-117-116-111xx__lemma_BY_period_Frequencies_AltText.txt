This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 20.71 and an absolute frequency of 445. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 20.71 and an absolute frequency of 445. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 445 ; absolute frequency: 20.7121247381894. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 73 ; absolute frequency: 11.167202080465. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 4.49337227589306
