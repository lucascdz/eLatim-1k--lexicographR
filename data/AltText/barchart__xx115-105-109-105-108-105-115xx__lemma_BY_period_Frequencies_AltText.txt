This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The II.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 7.85 and an absolute frequency of 3. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 4.74 and an absolute frequency of 31. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is I.a.C. with the normalized value of 2.65 and an absolute freqeuncy of 57. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 57 ; absolute frequency: 2.65301373050966. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 31 ; absolute frequency: 4.74223649992351. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 3 ; absolute frequency: 7.85340314136126. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 4.49337227589306
