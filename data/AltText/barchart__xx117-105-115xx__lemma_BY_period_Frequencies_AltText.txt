This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 11.17 and an absolute frequency of 240. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 8.26 and an absolute frequency of 54. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 240 ; absolute frequency: 11.1705841284617. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 54 ; absolute frequency: 8.26067003212483. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 4 ; absolute frequency: 10.4712041884817. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
