This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 6.12 and an absolute frequency of 40. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 6.12 and an absolute frequency of 40. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 105 ; absolute frequency: 4.887130556202. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 40 ; absolute frequency: 6.11901483861098. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 5.23560209424084. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
