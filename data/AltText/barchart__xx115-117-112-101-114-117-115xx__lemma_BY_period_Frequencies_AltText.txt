This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 15.87 and an absolute frequency of 341. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 6.73 and an absolute frequency of 44. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 341 ; absolute frequency: 15.8715382825227. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 44 ; absolute frequency: 6.73091632247208. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 5 ; absolute frequency: 13.0890052356021. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
