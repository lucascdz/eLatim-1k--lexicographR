This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 12.05 and an absolute frequency of 259. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 7.34 and an absolute frequency of 48. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 259 ; absolute frequency: 12.0549220386316. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 48 ; absolute frequency: 7.34281780633318. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 3 ; absolute frequency: 7.85340314136126. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
