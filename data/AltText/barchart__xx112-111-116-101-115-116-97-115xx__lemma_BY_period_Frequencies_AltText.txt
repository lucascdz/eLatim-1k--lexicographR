This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The IV.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 11.23 and an absolute frequency of 5. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 4.98 and an absolute frequency of 107. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 107 ; absolute frequency: 4.98021875727252. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 8 ; absolute frequency: 1.2238029677222. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 5 ; absolute frequency: 11.2334306897326
