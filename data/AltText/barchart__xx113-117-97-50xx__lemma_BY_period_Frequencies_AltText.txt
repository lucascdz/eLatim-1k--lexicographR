This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 14.69 and an absolute frequency of 96. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 14.69 and an absolute frequency of 96. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 125 ; absolute frequency: 5.81801256690714. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 96 ; absolute frequency: 14.6856356126664. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 5 ; absolute frequency: 13.0890052356021. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
