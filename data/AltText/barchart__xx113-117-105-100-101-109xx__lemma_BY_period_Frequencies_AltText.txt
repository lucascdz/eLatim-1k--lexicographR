This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 24.48 and an absolute frequency of 526. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 17.29 and an absolute frequency of 113. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 526 ; absolute frequency: 24.4821968815453. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 113 ; absolute frequency: 17.286216919076. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 8 ; absolute frequency: 20.9424083769633. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
