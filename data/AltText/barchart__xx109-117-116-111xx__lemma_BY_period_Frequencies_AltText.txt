This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 6.42 and an absolute frequency of 42. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 6.42 and an absolute frequency of 42. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 45 ; absolute frequency: 2.09448452408657. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 42 ; absolute frequency: 6.42496558054153. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 5.23560209424084. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
