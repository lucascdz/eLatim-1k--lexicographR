This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 6.27 and an absolute frequency of 41. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 4.79 and an absolute frequency of 103. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 103 ; absolute frequency: 4.79404235513149. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 41 ; absolute frequency: 6.27199020957626. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
