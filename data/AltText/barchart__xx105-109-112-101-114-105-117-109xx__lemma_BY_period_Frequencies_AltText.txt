This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The II.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 26.18 and an absolute frequency of 10. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 9.49 and an absolute frequency of 204. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 204 ; absolute frequency: 9.49499650919246. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 15 ; absolute frequency: 2.29463056447912. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 10 ; absolute frequency: 26.1780104712042. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
