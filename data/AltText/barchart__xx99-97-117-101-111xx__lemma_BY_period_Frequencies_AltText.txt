This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The II.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 2.62 and an absolute frequency of 1. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 2.28 and an absolute frequency of 49. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 49 ; absolute frequency: 2.2806609262276. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 7 ; absolute frequency: 1.07082759675692. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 1 ; absolute frequency: 2.61780104712042. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
