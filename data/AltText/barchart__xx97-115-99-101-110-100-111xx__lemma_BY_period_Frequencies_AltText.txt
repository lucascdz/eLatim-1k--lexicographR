This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The IV.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 24.71 and an absolute frequency of 11. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 0.56 and an absolute frequency of 12. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 12 ; absolute frequency: 0.558529206423086. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 3 ; absolute frequency: 0.458926112895824. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 11 ; absolute frequency: 24.7135475174118
