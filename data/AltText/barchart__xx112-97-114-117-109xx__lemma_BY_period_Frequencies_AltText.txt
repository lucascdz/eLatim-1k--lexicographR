This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 9.77 and an absolute frequency of 210. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 9.77 and an absolute frequency of 210. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 210 ; absolute frequency: 9.774261112404. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 52 ; absolute frequency: 7.95471929019428. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 3 ; absolute frequency: 7.85340314136126. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
