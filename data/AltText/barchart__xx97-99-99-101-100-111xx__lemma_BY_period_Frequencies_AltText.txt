This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The II.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 5.24 and an absolute frequency of 2. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 4.9 and an absolute frequency of 32. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is I.a.C. with the normalized value of 4 and an absolute freqeuncy of 86. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 86 ; absolute frequency: 4.00279264603212. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 32 ; absolute frequency: 4.89521187088879. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 5.23560209424084. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 4.49337227589306
