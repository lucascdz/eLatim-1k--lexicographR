This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The II.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 15.71 and an absolute frequency of 6. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 3.54 and an absolute frequency of 76. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 76 ; absolute frequency: 3.53735164067954. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 14 ; absolute frequency: 2.14165519351384. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 6 ; absolute frequency: 15.7068062827225. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
