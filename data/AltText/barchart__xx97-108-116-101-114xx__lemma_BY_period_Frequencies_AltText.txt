This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The II.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 13.09 and an absolute frequency of 5. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 10.15 and an absolute frequency of 218. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 218 ; absolute frequency: 10.1466139166861. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 61 ; absolute frequency: 9.33149762888175. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 5 ; absolute frequency: 13.0890052356021. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
