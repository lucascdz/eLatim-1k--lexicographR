This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The IV.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 11.23 and an absolute frequency of 5. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 3.37 and an absolute frequency of 22. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 35 ; absolute frequency: 1.629043518734. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 22 ; absolute frequency: 3.36545816123604. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 5 ; absolute frequency: 11.2334306897326
