This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 15.45 and an absolute frequency of 101. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 2.56 and an absolute frequency of 55. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 55 ; absolute frequency: 2.55992552943914. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 101 ; absolute frequency: 15.4505124674927. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
