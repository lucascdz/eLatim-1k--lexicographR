This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 9.94 and an absolute frequency of 65. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 9.94 and an absolute frequency of 65. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 75 ; absolute frequency: 3.49080754014429. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 65 ; absolute frequency: 9.94339911274285. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 3 ; absolute frequency: 7.85340314136126. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
