This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 11.47 and an absolute frequency of 75. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 4.65 and an absolute frequency of 100. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 100 ; absolute frequency: 4.65441005352572. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 75 ; absolute frequency: 11.4731528223956. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 1 ; absolute frequency: 2.61780104712042. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
