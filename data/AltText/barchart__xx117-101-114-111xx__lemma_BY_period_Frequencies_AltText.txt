This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 12.66 and an absolute frequency of 272. The II.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 2.62 and an absolute frequency of 1. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 2.62 and an absolute freqeuncy of 1. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 272 ; absolute frequency: 12.6599953455899. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 33 ; absolute frequency: 5.04818724185406. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 1 ; absolute frequency: 2.61780104712042. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 4 ; absolute frequency: 8.98674455178612
