This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 7.65 and an absolute frequency of 50. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 1.86 and an absolute frequency of 40. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 40 ; absolute frequency: 1.86176402141029. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 50 ; absolute frequency: 7.64876854826373. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
