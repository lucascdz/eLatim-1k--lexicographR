This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.a.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 25.6 and an absolute frequency of 550. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 15.14 and an absolute frequency of 99. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 550 ; absolute frequency: 25.5992552943914. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 99 ; absolute frequency: 15.1445617255622. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 6 ; absolute frequency: 15.7068062827225. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
