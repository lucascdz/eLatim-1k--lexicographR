This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 4.44 and an absolute frequency of 29. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 3.63 and an absolute frequency of 78. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 78 ; absolute frequency: 3.63043984175006. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 29 ; absolute frequency: 4.43628575799296. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
