This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 11.63 and an absolute frequency of 76. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 8.24 and an absolute frequency of 177. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 177 ; absolute frequency: 8.23830579474052. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 76 ; absolute frequency: 11.6261281933609. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 4.49337227589306
