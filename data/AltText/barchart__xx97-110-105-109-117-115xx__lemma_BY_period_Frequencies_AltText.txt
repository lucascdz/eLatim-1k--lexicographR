This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 37.33 and an absolute frequency of 244. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 21.32 and an absolute frequency of 458. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 458 ; absolute frequency: 21.3171980451478. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 244 ; absolute frequency: 37.325990515527. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 7 ; absolute frequency: 18.3246073298429. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
