This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 18.36 and an absolute frequency of 120. The I.a.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 16.48 and an absolute frequency of 354. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is IV.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 354 ; absolute frequency: 16.476611589481. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 120 ; absolute frequency: 18.3570445158329. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 4 ; absolute frequency: 10.4712041884817. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0
