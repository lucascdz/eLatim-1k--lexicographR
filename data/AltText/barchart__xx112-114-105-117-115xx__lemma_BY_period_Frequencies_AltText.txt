This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The IV.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 4.49 and an absolute frequency of 2. The I.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 2.75 and an absolute frequency of 18. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is I.a.C. with the normalized value of 2.51 and an absolute freqeuncy of 54. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 54 ; absolute frequency: 2.51338142890389. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 18 ; absolute frequency: 2.75355667737494. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 1 ; absolute frequency: 2.61780104712042. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 2 ; absolute frequency: 4.49337227589306
