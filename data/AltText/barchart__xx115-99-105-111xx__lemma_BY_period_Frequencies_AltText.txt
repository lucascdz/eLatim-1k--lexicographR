This charts plots the frequency of lemma by period_Frequencies. The I.d.C. subcorpus registers the highest normalized frequency, with the value of 16.06 and an absolute frequency of 105. The II.d.C. subcorpus follows, with a normalized frequency of 0 and an absolute frequency of 0. the subcorpus with the least normalized frequency is II.d.C. with the normalized value of 0 and an absolute freqeuncy of 0. here are all the values: subcorpus: I.a.C. ; normalized frequency: 247 ; absolute frequency: 11.4963928322085. subcorpus: I.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 105 ; absolute frequency: 16.0624139513538. subcorpus: II.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 0 ; absolute frequency: 0. subcorpus: IV.d.C. ; normalized frequency: 7 ; absolute frequency: 15.7268029656257
